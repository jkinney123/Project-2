url in api routes js file should match the url for api calls in public js file.

html routes are for posting to specified html docs. Will not need because only one page will display device info from one table.

Next step: javascript file. Make sure everything is matching up and linked together. If need be, we can ignore having the second table for joins and have just on username/password combo (will be problematic as this is how we are fulfilling our POST request requirement). Focus on the GET request first. Don't worry about fancier stuff yet.

After doing GETs: clean up layout in css and work on PUT and POST request. Will need to work with Back End team for this.
